### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hazz Saeed Haris, a Project Engineer at Wipro with a passion for problem solving, RPA, Python and Gen AI. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on leveraging Python and Pandas for data analysis and visualization projects, as well as exploring machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m continuously learning and expanding my skills in cloud computing, particularly in Azure and Google Cloud, and deepening my understanding of generative AI and prompt engineering.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data analysis, Python programming, cloud computing, or any project you're interested in collaborating on!

âš¡ Fun fact: I was part of the top 10 team in the Mishmash COVID 19 Hackathon, and I enjoy participating in spelling bee contests!
